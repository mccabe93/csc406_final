Running the program will draw the initial surface of the function F(x,y) = x^2 + y^2

	Using numbers 1,2,3 on the keyboard will switch between 3 available functions for the surface
		1. F(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
		2. F(x,y) = (x^3 - 3x) + (y^3 - 3y)
		3. F(x,y) = x + y

It will also draw the normal vectors for each point in the surface and it will draw the textured ball at the top right of the surface.

The ball is textured as an image of the earth that is wrapped around the sphere.

Holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse will relatively translate the location of the perspective.

Holding the right mouse button and moving the mouse will relatively rotate the perspective around the z axis for left and right movement
	and around the x axis for up and down movement.

NOTE that in our perspective we rotate the x,y,z such that the z is now pointing up and the x and y are rotated some to show an almost
isometric view of the surface to start.

The mouse wheel can be used to zoom in and out.

Hitting space plays/pauses the animation.

'n' resets the simulation.

'.' increases the velocity of the ball
',' decreases the velocity of the ball
'k' decreases the drag of the ball
'l' increases the drag of the ball
'z' decreases the ball's radius
'x' increases the ball's radius
'[' increases the ball's x position
']' decreases the ball's x position
'-' increases the ball's y position
'=' decreases the ball's y position

Lastly, hitting  'r' resets the perspective to its default.
